ErgoScript Contracts for the Phoenix implementation of HodlCoin.

## Implementation Type
1. [hodlERG](/hodlERG/README.md)
2. [hodlToken](/hodlToken/README.md)

## Fair Forking Rule

The hodlCoin R&D team wishes to promote permissionless forking of hodlCoin's concept in a way 
that maximizes common wealth and promotes a culture of fair innovation and reuse of innovations, 
while maintaining the ability of innovators to be rewarded for their work. 

To this aim, the hodlCoin team generously licenses its work for commercial use by others as long as the Fair Forking Rule is satisfied.
This rule is stated in the second page of the [hodlCoin Paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1029.pdf).

**If you would like to fork hodlCoin's concept, you can. 
But you must satisfy the fair forking rule.**

This implementation is a faithful implementation of the hodlCoin protocol and it satisfies the fair forking rule.
